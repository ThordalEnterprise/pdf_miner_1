# pdf_miner_1

[Intro]

This script analyzes a set of PDF files by searching for a specific word or phrase and extracting text containing the searched text. The script then processes the text, removing stopwords and counting the frequency of words that appear. The frequency data is then written to a file. The script also searches a single PDF file called "Literature_review.pdf" for the word "Scheduling" and extracts text and saves the data to a file called "Research_input_data.txt". The script utilizes the following libraries: PyPDF2, os, re, pandas, numpy, collections, matplotlib, and statistics.
